THE CORNELL UNIVERSITY SOUTHEAST ASIA PROGRAM

The Southeast Asia Program was organized at Cornell
University in the Department of Far Eastern Studies in
1950.  It is a teaching and research program of interdisciplinary
studies in the humanities, social sciences,
and some natural sciences.  It deals with Southeast Asia
as a region, and with the individual countries of the
area:  Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

The activities of the Program are carried on both at
Cornell and in Southeast Asia.  They include an undergraduate
and graduate curriculum at Cornell which provides
instruction by specialists in Southeast Asian cultural
history and present-day affairs and offers intensive
training in each of the major languages of the area.  The
Program sponsors group research projects on Thailand, on
Indonesia, on the Philippines, and on the area's Chinese
minorities.  At the same time, individual staff and
students of the Program have done field research in every
Southeast Asian country.

A list of publications relating to Southeast Asia
which may be obtained on prepaid order directly from the
Program is given at the end of this volume.  Information
on Program staff, fellowships, requirements for degrees,
and current course offerings will be found in an Announcement
of the Department of Asian Studies, obtainable from
the Director, Southeast Asia Program, 120 Uris Hall, Cornell
University, Ithaca, New York 14850.

PREFACE

This work is a dictionary of Cebuano Visayan, the language of the central part of the
Philippines and much of Mindanao. Although the explanations are given in English, the aim of
this work is not to provide English equivalents but to explain Cebuano forms in terms of
themselves. It is meant as a reference work for Cebuano speakers and as a tool for students of
the Cebuano language. There is a total of some 25,000 entries and an addenda of 700 forms
which were prepared after the dictionary had been composed.

This dictionary is the product of eleven years work by more than a hundred persons. The
work was edited by me and is my responsibility, but the sources are entirely native, and all
illustrations are composed by native speakers. The personnel who wrote up the entries are listed
in Section 2.1, p. ix. The manuscript went through five versions, the final on an IBM selectric
composer. The whole composition was done in Cebu City in five months' time by Pacifico
Briones, Nicolasito Catingan, Florecita Florido, Donata Laingo, and Grace Mendoza. The
drafting and splicing were done by Carlito Gubaynon and Felismeno Simplicio. The proofreading
and editing was done by me together with Mrs. Elizabeth Say, Mrs. Fe Cuenca,
Richard Quiñanola, and my wife Ida Wolff. In the earlier stages of gathering, transcribing, and
indexing materials a huge number of people participated, too numerous to mention by name.
The entire dictionary through the final composed product was compiled from notes on index
cards in the course of twenty-six months. My thanks go especially to the staff listed above and
on p. ix for their cooperative spirit. Without their willingness to work overtime, this dictionary
could not have been completed.

The work was supported from 1963 to 1966 by funds from Cornell University faculty research
grants; 1966-7 by Office of Education contract No. 1-7-002672-2040; 1967-1968 by a
Cornell University faculty research grant; 1968-1969 by a grant from the American Council of
Learned Societies and by a grant from the Cornell University Philippine Project; 1969-1971
by Office of Education Contract No. 0-9-097718-3350. My trip to the Philippines was financed
in 1966-1969 and again in 1970-71 by a Fulbright-Hayes faculty research grant. Without these
sources of funds this dictionary could not have been completed.

This dictionary by no means exhausts the Cebuano language, and we hope in future years
to produce an expanded and improved version with illustrations. To this end we welcome
and would be most grateful for suggestions for corrections and additions.

FOREWORD

The Southeast Asia Program takes particular pleasure in helping to make this Cebuano dictionary
available. The language is, of course, of importance in itself, not only because of its wide
use in the Philippines, but also because of its value to linguists and historical research.

In addition, we are especially pleased that this dictionary is a joint publication of the Southeast
Asia Program and the Linguistic Society of the Philippines. We owe a special debt of gratitude
to the Rev. Teodoro Llamzon, S. J., president of the Linguistic Society of the Philippines,
for his gracious help and cooperation in attending to the many details involved in such a coopertive[**cooperative?]
venture. We are also grateful to the Asia Foundation, which provided a partial subsidy to
make publication possible.

We are confident that Professor Wolff's research on Cebuano and the compilation of this
work, covering a period of eleven years, has resulted in a useful reference work and in an important
contribution to our knowledge of Philippine languages and cultures and to linguistics
in general.

INTRODUCTION

1.0  Cebuano

This work is a dictionary of Cebuano Visayan, here called Cebuano for short. Cebuano is
spoken in the central portions of the Philippines: on the islands of Cebu and Bohol, on the
eastern half of Negros, western half of Leyte, along the northern coasts of Mindanao, and on
smaller islands in the vicinity of these areas. A large portion of the urban population of Zamboanga,
Davao, and Cotabato is Cebuano speaking. Cebuano is also widely spoken throughout the lowland
areas of the entire eastern third of Mindanao, where it is spreading at the expense of the native
languages (most of which are closely related to Cebuano). Cebuano is the trade language in most
places in Mindanao where Cebuano-speaking populations and populations speaking other languages
are in contact.

Cebuano is also called Sugbuanon and is one of more than a dozen languages or dialects which
are given the name Bisayan or Visayan. Other types of Visayan are spoken in areas surrounding
the Cebuano-speaking area on the north, east, west, and southeast. This dictionary is confined to
Cebuano forms and does not include forms which are not Cebuano from other languages called
Visayan spoken outside of the area we have delineated.

In the areas where Cebuano is native and, to a large extent, also in areas where Cebuano is a
trade language, it is used for almost every aspect of daily life and for most formal occasions:
radio-TV, social life, religious life, business, and the first two grades of school. Cebuano is also
largely used in the later grades, although English is supposed to be the medium of instruction. In
these areas Cebuano language publications enjoy a wide readership.

Somewhere between one-quarter and one-third of the population of the Philippines speaks
Cebuano natively.[1] But despite its numerical importance and wide use Cebuano lags far behind
Tagalog (Pilipino[**?]) in prestige and development as a means of literary and scientific expression.
In the schools the emphasis is almost entirely English: Cebuano composition is not a school subject,
and students read nothing in Cebuano after the first two grades. In prestige Cebuano is losing
ground: for the upper and middle class elite, with isolated praiseworthy exceptions, eloquence in
Cebuano is not admired. In fact it is almost a matter of pride not to know Cebuano well. Thus,
despite a phenomenal increase in literacy and in the total number of potential contributors and
participants in Cebuano literature, output has declined in quantity and quality at an ever increasing
rate over the past two generations. The cultivation and development of Cebuano is left to the
least influential segments of the population, to whom English education and exposure to English
publications are minimally available. These people still compose the vast majority of the population,
but the influential classes that have grown up knowing only a dilute and inarticulate Cebuano
are ever increasing in number, proportion, and prestige.

1.1   Dialects

The Cebuano language is remarkably uniform. There are differences, to be sure, but these
differences are no greater than the differences found among the various varieties of English spoken
around the world. There are scattered places within the Cebuano area which use a speech widely
aberrant from what we describe here: Surigao, Bantayan Islands, and the Camotes Islands. Forms
peculiar to those areas we have simply omitted except for a few widely used forms which tend to
find their way into standard Cebuano as spoken by natives of these areas. Such forms are listed,
but marked 'dialectal'. Otherwise whatever forms we have found we have listed without comment,
whether or not they are in current use throughout the Cebuano speech area.

1 We arrive at this figure by totalling the population of towns and villages in Cebuano-speaking areas in the
Census of 1960 (about seven and a half million). There are no accurate figures as to language affiliation for the
population in the Philippines.
-----File: 0009.png---\jhellingman\TIMP\Long Green\------------------------

1.12 Correct and incorrect speech

A happy consequence of the low regard which Cebuano speakers have of their own language is
that the doctrine of correctness has never gained foothold. Dialectal differences are purely local,
not social,[1] and speakers regard whatever forms they are familiar with as correct. We have followed
the same principle in this dictionary: no attempt is made to prescribe which forms or
usages are appropriate, but rather we try to show which forms and usages occur. The various
meanings of a given form are listed in such a way that their relation is readily discernible:
meanings which are derived by extension or specialization from an original meaning are listed
under subheadings of the original-meaning.[2]

Occasionally annotations such as 'slang', 'euphemism', 'humorous', 'coarse', and the like, are
given. These annotations signal only that Cebuano speakers tend to regard these forms as such
and that they occur only in styles of speech appropriate to these forms.[3] We use the following
terminology: Biblical, literary, metaphorical, humorous, euphemism, coarse, colloquial. The designation
BIBLICAL indicates a form confined to liturgical language or the Bible; LITERARY indicates
a form confined to high-flown styles, not ordinarily spoken; METAPHORICAL indicates a meaning
recognized as metaphorical in some way (not necessarily confined to literary style); HUMOROUS,
a meaning commonly given to a form, but not the primary meaning, which gives the feeling of an
oft-repeated joke; EUPHEMISM, a form that is used to avoid saying s.t directly, the meaning of
which is readily understood but not as jarring as if it had been said directly; COARSE, a form that
clearly would jar the hearer and that is confined to speech used in anger or used as a sign of intimacy
or disrespect; SLANG indicates a form confined to intimate speech among people of similar
occupations or life styles; COLLOQUIAL indicates forms avoided in formal discourse or writing,
but commonly used in normal speech even among non-intimates.

2.0 Basis of this work

This dictionary is a comprehensive listing of approximately 25,000 Cebuano roots with English
explanations of their meanings and uses and an indication of the affixational system to which each
root is subject, with ample illustrations. Most of the forms here listed are taken from written
sources or from taped oral sources of Cebuano of nearly a million words, gathered from all over
the Cebuano speech area and covering a wide range of topics and styles. The written sources are
some 400 issues of Cebuano publications: Bisaya, Silaw, and Bag-ong Suga, a few novenas, novels,
and other collections that have been published.[4] About ninety percent of the forms here listed
come from these oral or printed sources. Forms which did not occur in these sources but which
were well known to me or at least one of the members of the staff that composed this dictionary
are also included. Further, any form which occured[**occurred?] in our sources which was not known to our
personnel was not included.[5] Although there are numerous published sources of Cebuano forms--dictionaries
and anthropological and biological studies, we have not taken any forms from them
that could not be confirmed directly from our texts or informants.


1 Use of English and to some extent, Spanish, has the function of distinguishing the upper classes from the
ordinary folks, rather than class dialect.

2 Thus, for example, in our definition of danggit (a name given to a small fish) we define as follows: 1 name
given to small species of Teuthis with dots. 2 by extension, name given to any small specimen or any species of
Teuthis. This definition reflects the usage of fishermen who call any small dotted species of Teuthis, genuine
danggit (danggit nga pyúr), but any species of Teuthis with no dots are called aberrant forms of the danggit--other
related fish are called danggit sa hunásan 'the danggit of the tidal flats' or danggit nga ngisingisi 'the danggit
like the ngisingisi fish, etc.) Further, by fishermen these other species of Teuthis are given their own names:
danghili and lilu kan; but among housewives and in the market all these fish are called danggit.

3 Just as in an English dictionary we must indicate that the term 'vagina' is appropriate to a family-planning
lecture, whereas, 'cunt' is not, so in Cebuano we must indicate that the term kinatáwu sa babáyi 'female genitalia'
is fine for a family planning lecture but bilat 'cunt' is not. We do this by characterizing kinatáwu sa babáyi
as a euphemism and characterizing bilat as coarse. We do not wish to say that one of these alternative forms is
better than the other, nor do we mean to say that 'coarse' forms in Cebuano are taboo. (They are not taboo in
the same way that the English four-letter words are, even though for formal occasions they are avoided.)

4 Aside from a few catechisms and novenas, there are practically no specimens of Cebuano extant which
antedate this century, and even prewar literary productions are extremely difficult to come by. Aside from the
forms marked 'Biblical', everything here listed is contemporary speech.

5 Approximately five percent of our data is not included for lack of reliable informants. These are mainly
forms of only local currency, a large portion of them from Bohol.
-----File: 0010.png---\jhellingman\TIMP\Long Green\------------------------

2.1   Personnel

The collection, transcription, and classification of the texts was carried out by a large staff in
Cebu City, originating from all over the Cebuano speech area. The final stage, the writing up of
the definitions, was carried by a small staff, exclusively native speakers of Cebuano now resident
in Cebu: Miss E. Agapay, of Malitbog, Leyte, but also a long time resident of Talibon, Bohol, and
in Guihulngan, Negros Oriental; Nicolas Ampatin, of Malitbog, Leyte; Abel Angus, of Tudela,
Camotes; José Dioko, of Malaboyoc, Cebu; Mrs. E. Emnace, of Dumanjug, Cebu; Atty. A. Estorco,
of Guihulngan, Negros Oriental; Everett Mendoza, of Maasin, Leyte; Mrs. D. Ag. Villondo, of Dumanjug,
Cebu, but also a long time resident of Ozamis City, and Molave, Zamboanga del Sur.

2.2  Other sources

The scientific names for plants and shells are based upon specimens which were gathered and
identified with their Cebuano names by reliable informants. The specimens were compared against
the available literature, and where identification was certain, scientific names were given. Our
scientific names for plants are taken from the following sources (in order--plants not listed in
the first were referred to the second, those not in the first or second were referred to the third,
and so forth): Brown, Quisumbing, Merrill, Steiner. For shellfish, we give no scientific names but
follow the English terminology of Abbott, 1962. For the fishes and birds, we relied mainly on pictures
for Cebuano identification. For fish available in the local markets, we could examine actual
specimens. The scientific names of fish follow those given by Herre (1953) and for birds by Delacour
and Myer.

We made heavy use of the anthropological sources listed in the bibliography but independently
checked all information incorporated and used terminology listed in them only insofar as we
could corroborate it.

3.0 Phonology and transcription

The following chart gives the Cebuano phonemes and the articulation:

                                 Consonants
                   bilabial   apico-alveolar   palatal   dorsal   glottal

voiceless stops    p          t                c         k        [?]
voiced stops       b          d                j         g
nasals             m          n                          [ng]
spirants                      s                                     h
liquids            w          l, r             y

                                  Vowels

high- or mid-front        low central    high- or mid-back
	i	                a               u


In addition there is a fourth mid-central vowel which occurs dialectally (Bohol, Southern Leyte,
Southern Cebu, and other scattered areas) but is not found in the dialect of Cebu City and is not
transcribed here.[1] The palatal stop /j/ in many dialects does not contrast with the cluster /dy/. In
the dialect of the Camotes Islands there is also a voiced spirant /z/ which derives historically from
/y/ but contrasts with /y/ currently.

Vowels may be long or short. Contrast between long and short vowels occurs only in the final
and the penultimate syllable of the word: káun [k[=á][?]un] 'eat' and nagdá [nagd[=á]] 'is bringing'.
Further, there is only one long vowel per word. There is also a phoneme of stress which has a very
low contrastive function. For the most part stress can be determined by the phonological make-up
of the word: 1 stress falls on the long vowel of the word if the word has long vowel: nagdá
[nagd[=á]], káun [k[=á][?]un]. 2 for words that have no long vowel, stress is on the penultimate if it is


1 In the Cebuano of Cebu City and most Cebuano-speaking areas, the mid-central vowel falls together with
/u/. Nice as it would have been to include information on which forms with /u/ are with a mid-central vowel
dialectally, such information is extremely difficult to come by, and so we reluctantly had to leave this information
to be supplied in future editions.
-----File: 0011.png---\jhellingman\TIMP\Long Green\------------------------
closed: tan-aw [tán[?]aw] 'see'; mugbù [múgbu[?]] 'short'. If the penultimate is open and short, stress
is on the ultimate: mala [malá] 'dry'. Occasionally, in words with a closed penult the final syllable
is stressed (marked here with a wedge): mand[va]r [mandár] 'order'; dugh[vi]t [dughít] 'instrument
for poking'. In words with a long vowel in the ultimate syllable there is, in some dialects, a contrast
between the stress on the first mora and stress on the second mora of the long vowel: nah[=ú]g
[nahúug] 'fell'; húg [huúg] 'woof'. This contrast does not obtain in all dialects.

3.2 Transcription

The transcription here adopted adheres as closely as possible to the spelling found in Cebuano
publications and at the same time is strictly phonemic--that is, each phoneme is indicated, and
no phoneme in a given environment is given more than one transcription. Our transcription follows
the phonemic symbols given in the Chart 3.0 with the exceptions listed in the following sections.

3.21   Vowels

We write only three vowels: i, u, a. In Cebuano publications /i/ is sometimes written i, sometimes
e, but with no consistency; and /u/ sometimes is written u, sometimes o (again with no consistency).
But here the letters e and o are not used.

Long vowels are indicated with an acute accent: nagdá [nagd[=á]] 'is bringing', lána [l[=á]na]
'coconut oil'. (Cebuano publications occasionally indicate long vowels by doubling them, but
most frequently long vowels are ignored.)

Stress is not indicated if the placement is according to the rules given in Section 3.0, above.
Where a word with a closed penult has a stress on the final syllable, this fact is indicated by a
wedge: mand[va]r [mandár] 'order'. For words with a long vowel in the final syllable where the
stress is on the final mora, the acute accent indicates the long vowel and stress on the final mora:
húg [huúg] 'woof, trák [traák] 'bus'. For words with a long vowel in the final syllable where
the stress is on the first mora, the stress on the first mora and length are indicated by a combination
of a long mark and acute accent: nah[=ú]g [nahúug] 'fell', ang-[=á]ng [[?]ang[?]áang] 'not quite'.

3.22  Glottal stop /[?]/

In Cebuano publications /[?]/ is only sometimes indicated.[1] Here we indicate /[?]/ in word or
syllable final position with a grave accent written over the vowel which precedes the glottal stop:
walà /walá[?]/ 'no', bàbà /bá[?]ba[?]/ 'mouth', làhib /lá[?]hib/ 'slice'. (In Cebuano publications the
glottal stop of these words is never indicated.)

In post-consonantal position we indicate /[?]/ with a hyphen, as is done in most Cebuano publications:
tan-aw /tan[?]aw/ 'see'. In other positions--that is, intervocalically and in word initial
position, glottal stop is not written, as is also the usual practice in Cebuano publications: writing
of two adjacent vowels or initial vowel serves to indicate a glottal stop:[2] maáyu /ma[?][=á]yu/ 'good',
alas /[?]alás/ 'ace'.

3.23   /n/, /c/, /j/, /dy/, /ty/

The phoneme /[ng]/ is transcribed ng, as in Cebuano publications: bángun /bá[ng]un/ 'get up'. The
sequence /ng/ is transcribed n-g: san-glas /sanglas/ 'sunglasses'.

/c/ is transcribed ts, as in Cebuano publications: tsinílas /cinílas/ 'slippers'[3]. The sequence /ty/
is transcribed ty (as in Cebuano publications): tyanggi /tyánggi/ 'market'.

The phoneme /j/ is transcribed initially and medially as dy: dyíp /jíp/ 'jeep', dyus /jus/ 'juice'.
(In Cebuano publications /j/ is sometimes written dy, sometimes diy: diyip or dyip--i.e. the
spelling of /j/ is no different from that of /dy/.) In final position /j/ is transcribed ds, following
the usage in Cebuano publications: dyurds /jurj/ 'a name--George'.[4] The sequence /dy/ is tran-*


1 The glottal stop in post-consonantal position is usually indicated in Cebuano publications by a hyphen (as
we do): tan-aw /tán[?]aw/ 'see', spelled tan-aw (but sometimes also as tanaw). Between vowels a glottal stop is
occasionally indicated, again with a hyphen: maáyu /ma[?]áyu/ 'good', spelled maayu, maayo, ma-ayo, or ma-ayu.

2 In initial position there is no contrast between /[?]/ and its absence, and phonetically the [[?]] is always articulated.
Intervocalically there is no contrast between successive like vowels and like vowels separated by a /[?]/
(between [aa] and [a[?]a]; [uu] and [u[?]u] ; [ii] and [i[?]i] ), and phonetically the [[?]] is always present. Between
unlike vowels there is either a [[?]] or a [w] or [y] glide.

3 [ts] does not contrast with [c]. Morphologically, when a suffix -s is added to a base which ends in /t/ the
combination is automatically becomes [c] : Rit 'name' plus -s 'diminutive suffix' = Rits [ric].

4 A sequence [ds] or [dy] does not occur in final position. When a suffix -s is added to a base ending with d
the combination ds automatically becomes [j] : Pid 'name' plus-s 'diminutive suffix' = Pids [pij].
-----File: 0012.png---\jhellingman\TIMP\Long Green\------------------------
*scribed diy: diyus /dyus/ 'god'. (This sequence is spelled diy or, alternatively, dy in Cebuano
publications.)[1]

3.24 Ciy and Cy; Cuw and Cw; ayi and ay; awu and aw

The contrast between /Ciy/ and /Cy/ and between /Cuw/ and /Cw/ (where C is any consonant)
obtains only in the position where the /y/ or /w/ precedes a vowel of the final syllable (e.g. paliya
[paliyá] 'k.o. vegetable' vs. palya [pálya] 'fail'). When the /y/ or /w/ precedes a vowel of the
penultimate or earlier syllable, the contrast does not obtain. If one consonant precedes the /y/ or
/w/ we write Cy and Cw; biyà 'leftovers' but hibyaan /hi-byà-an/ 'be left behind'; guwà 'go out',
higwaan 'gone out from'. If two consonants precede the /y/ or /w/ we write Ciy and Cuw respectively:
pinsiyunáda 'one who receives a pension', nagkuwarisma 'have a sad expression' (but Kwarisma
'Lent').

Similarly, the contrast between /Vyi/ and /Vy/ or /Vwu/ and /Vw/ (where V is any vowel)
obtains only when the /y/ or /yi/, /w/ or /wu/ are final in the word: bay 'term of address' vs. bayi
'female'; mabaw 'shallow' vs. hibawu (or hibáwu) 'know'. In closed final syllables or penultimate
or earlier syllables the contrast does not obtain. We write Vyi and Vwu in closed syllables and viy
and Vuw in open syllables: bayinti 'twenty' but ayta 'give me'; dawunggan 'ear' but awtu 'car'.

4.0 Listing of Entries

Cebuano is a language with a complex system of affixation and comparatively simple morphophonemic
alternations. For this reason the listing of forms is strictly by root.[2] Forms of the sort
where the root is not really evident are listed with a cross-reference to the root. The order is
strictly alphabetical with no regard to diacritical markings (hyphens or accent marks) except that
forms without diacritical markings precede forms with diacritical markings.

The order of presentation is always root alone or root plus verbal affixes (Section 6.1f.) followed
by verbal derivations (Section 6.2), followed by nominal and adjectival derivations, listed
in alphabetical order (Section 7.0). Most roots occur as several parts of speech, and the determination
of whether a root is basically a noun, adjective, or verb depends upon a series of morphological
and syntactic criteria the details of which cannot be presented here.[3] Roots which are
basically adjectives are defined first as adjectives, then as nouns and verbs. Roots, basically nouns,
are defined first as nouns, then as adjectives and verbs; and roots, basically verbs, are defined first
as verbs and then as nouns and adjectives. For verbal forms a formula indicating the conjugation
(set of inflectional affixes which may be added to them) is given. The formulas are explained in
Sections 7.1ff. and 7.2ff. below.

The entries are liberally illustrated, with the primary aim of clarifying the meaning and with a
secondary aim of exemplifying the morphological characteristics of the affixed forms.


1 Our transcription of diy for /dy/ is unequivocal, as I have come across no case where [diy] occurs in contrast
to [dy].

2 The exception to this rule is forms which contain dead affixes--affixes which are not part of the productive
or even live Cebuano morphological (inflectional and derivational) systems. Examples are takílid 'turn the
back', bakilid 'slope', which obviously have prefixes ta- and ba- respectively and are connected with the root
kílid 'side'. But since ba- and ta- are not part of the active Cebuano derivational system, we list them under
takílid and bakilid (with a cross reference to the root kílid). Such forms behave like roots, and it would only
complicate the task of the user if they were not to be listed with their dead affix.

3 One difference which sets off roots that are basically verbs from roots that are basically nouns and adjectives
is that verb roots may occur unaffixed with the meaning 'action of [doing so-and-so]' whereas nouns and
adjectives may not: Thus, lakaw 'walk', túyuk 'turn' are verbs because they occur unaffixed as nouns meaning
the action of walking, turning: káda lakaw níya, 'each time he walked'; káda túyuk níya, 'each time he turned
around'; but karsúnis 'trousers', ayruplánu 'airplane' are not because they do not occur in this meaning. (To
express 'action of wearing trousers' the prefix pag- must be added to the noun karsúnis: Gidilì ang pagkarsúnis
dinhi, 'It is forbidden to wear pants here.' Similarly a pag- must be added to ayruplánu to make a noun meaning
'action of ...': Ang pag-ayruplánu makapadali sa byáhi, 'Taking a plane hastens the trip.'

Roots that are basically adjectives are distinguished from noun roots in that they occur with a prefix ka- in
exclamations to mean 'how very [adjective]!' whereas nouns do not. Thus buguy 'tramp' is an adjective because
it occurs with ka- in this meaning: kabuguy níya 'what a tramp he is', whereas kutsi 'car' is not. (To express,
'what a car!' the suffix -a(<-) is used, not ka-: Ngilngígang kutsíha uy! 'My! What a car!')

5.0  Alternations

5.1   Morphophonemic alternations

Since the listing in this dictionary is strictly by root, an outline of the important morphophonemic
alternations is given here. In the entries nonpredictable morphophonemic alternations are
indicated by writing the affixed forms out.

5.11  Shift of stress

The general rule is that an affixed form has the stress on the same syllable as the root alone.
Where this general rule is broken, there is said to be SHIFT OF STRESS. When an affixed form has
final stress where the root had penultimate stress, there is said to be SHIFT TO THE FINAL SYLLABLE,
indicated by the symbol (->):

káun           /k[=á][?]un/        'eat'[**]        +   nag-(->)  =        nagkaun      /nagka[?]ún/ 'is eating'
tugnaw        /túgnaw/     'cold'      +   -un(->)    =        tugnawun    /tugnawún/ 'be cold'

When an affixed form has penultimate stress where the root had final stress, there is said to be
SHIFT TO THE PENULTIMATE SYLLABLE, indicated by the symbol (<-):

sakay          /sakáy/        'ride'      +   nag-(<-)  =   nagsákay     /nags[=á]kay[** /]    'ride together'

In many cases an unaffixed root has both final stress and penultimate stress (depending on the
meaning). Whichever stress occurs with the prefix MU- (see the entry under MU-) is taken to be
the stress of the root. Thus, the formation of the unaffixed root with a different stress pattern is
said to be by the addition of an affix consisting of shift of stress alone:

inúm[1]       /[?]inúm/       drink[**]      +        (<-)    =   ínum       /[?][=í]num/       drink heavily
búnal      /búnal/        beat        +        (->)    =   bunal      /bunál/        club

5.12 Dropping of vowels

When a suffix is added to a root with a stressed final syllable, the tendency is to drop the vowel
of the final syllable of the root:

dakup	/dakúp/ 	arrest 	+  -an   =     dakpan     /dákpan/     be arrested
pisik	/pisík/  	splash	+  -an   =     piskan     /pískan/     be splashed
lakat	/lakát/	       go     +  -unun =     laktunun   /laktunún/   errand

This occasionally also happens to roots with stressed penults:

kalímut /kalímut/    forget     +  -i            =        kalimti         /kalímti/     forget it

5.13   Adding of /h/ or /[?]/ to roots ending in a vowel when a suffix is added

Some roots which end in a vowel add /[?]/ before a suffix, some roots add /h/, other roots add
either /[?]/ or /h/ (depending on which suffix):

bása            /bása/         read        +   -un    =   basáhun       /basáhun/         be read
adtu            /[?]ádtu/       go          +  -un    =   adtúun        /[?]adt[=ú][?]un/      gone to get
kabaláka     /kabaláka/  worry     +  -an     =   kabalak-an /kabalák[?]an/   s.t.  to worry about
(with the vowel of the final syllable of the root dropped--5.12).
sulti            /súlti/         talk         +  -un     =   sultíhun       /sult[=í]hun/         talk it out
sulti            /súlti/         talk        +  -ánay  =   sultiánay     /sulti[?][=á]nay/     conversation

5.14  Metathesis

In affixed forms, the sequences /[?]C/ and /hC/ (where C is any consonant) almost always
become /C[?]/ and /Ch/:[2]

káun           /ká[?]un/       eat         +   -a       =   kan-a      /kán[?]a/        eat it (with the final
syllable of the root dropped).

1 The root is taken to be inum because the form containing mu- is muinum 'will drink'.

2 However, this is true only of the Cebu City dialect. Other dialects retain /[?]C/: kàna /ká[?]na/ 'eat it'.
-----File: 0014.png---\jhellingman\TIMP\triggerhippie77\-------------------
luhud /luhúd/ kneel + -an = ludhan /lúdhan/ kneel on (with the
vowel of the final syllable of the root dropped).

The sequences /[?]Vh/ usually becomes /hV[?]/ (where V is a vowel):

túu /tú[?]u/ believe +  -an     =   tuhúan /tuh[=ú][?]an/ believable (where
/h/ is intercalated by the rule of 5.13).

Sequences of a liquid or /s/ plus a consonant tend to be metathesized when a suffix is added if
the vowel of the final syllable of the root is dropped.

ngálan  /[ng]álan/ name + -an     = nganlan /[ng]ánlan/ be named

sulud /sulúd/ enter +   -un    = sudlun /súdlun/ enter it

inum /[?]inúm/ drink +  -a      = imna /[?]ímna/ drink it

putus /putús/ wrap +  -un    = pustun /pústun/ wrap it

lusut /lusút/ go through +  -an     = lutsan /l[=ú]can/ go through it

These alternations also manifest themselves in competing root forms: alhu /[?]álhu/ and hal-u
/hal[?]u/ 'pestle'; kalamunggay and kamalunggay 'k.o. tree'.

5.15 Change of /r/ or /l/ to /d, g, h/

Intervocalically, /d/ usually becomes /r/ or, less frequently, /l/:

búkid     mountain    +   ka-an      =   kabukíran or, alternatively, kabukílan mountains

Vice versa, in roots with intervocalic /l/ or /r/, the /l/ or /r/ may change to /d/ when final or abutting
on a consonant.

walà       /walá[?]/        be lost         +   -un    =        wad-un   /wad[?]un/    lose s.t. (with
loss of the final vowel of the root)[** .]

hurut      /hurút/        use up         +   -un    =        hutdun   /hútdun/     use s.t. up (with
metathesis[** ).]

When a /d/, /l/, or /r/ comes to abut on velar consonant it tends to change to /g/:[1]

pálung    /pálu[ng]/        extinguish   +  -an     =        pagngan /pág[ng]an/     extinguish it

haluk     /halúk/       kiss             +  -an     =        hagkan   /hágkan/     kiss it

/r/ or, occasionally, /l/ at the end of a root may change to /h/ when suffixes are added. These are
almost always words of Spanish provenience.

mantinil      make do with           +   -an     =        mantinihan      make do with it

imbitar        invite                       +  -un    =        imbitahun        invite him

5.2 Competing forms

Because of sound changes which took place over portions of the Cebuano-speaking areas but
did not spread over the entire area and the subsequent spread of forms which reflect these changes,
there are numerous competing forms which are of the same etymology and which usually (but
not always) have the same meaning.[2]

Forms which are the same in meaning and which are related to each other in that one underwent
the sound change and the other did not are defined only once and cross reference is made.
Some sound changes are so common and regular that only the older form is listed, and it is to be
taken for granted that the form which shows the sound change also normally occurs unless a
statement to the contrary is made.

1 Dialectally they change to /d/: hadkan, padngan.

2 In the strictest sense, of course, no two forms are the same in meaning: in English, for example, rather
pronounced to rhyme with father is different in meaning from rather pronounced [ræ[-d][**schwa]r]. One is a strange or
affected word and the other is a normal word. But which form is normal is all a matter of what part of the
country one comes from, and a dictionary which is not regionally biased must list them as synonymous. Similarly,
in Cebuano for any given speaker, where several forms compete, usually only one form is normal; but, as in
the case of the two rather's in English, the two competing forms are most often synonymous from the dictionary's
point of view.
-----File: 0015.png---\jhellingman\maning\triggerhippie77\-----------------

5.21   Dropping of /l/

5.211   Intervocalic /l/

Most (but not all) roots which contain an /l/ between /a/'s and /u/'s compete with roots which
lack /l/. The forms without /l/ are used generally in the Northeastern portion of the Cebuano
area: all areas east of Cebu (Bohol, Masbate, Leyte and islands in between) and on the northern
half of Cebu. In the Southwestern areas (Negros, southern half of Cebu and most of Mindanao,[**unclear if there's a letter after "o"]
the /l/ forms predominate.

Between like vowels /l/ is dropped and the vowel is usually lengthened: kalabaw or kábaw
'water buffalo'; balay or báy 'house'; tutulu or tutú 'three'. In closed syllables or in the case of
/l/ beginning the antepenult, no compensatory lengthening takes place: kalatkat or katkat 'climb';
kalamunggay or kamunggay 'k.o. tree'.

Between /a/ and /u/ or /u/ and /a/, /l/ becomes /w/: lalum or lawum 'deep'; sulab or suwab
'blade'. The sequence /alu/ in the antepenult and penult or earlier in the root becomes /u/ in
Cebu and northern Leyte but /awu/ in Bohol and southern Leyte: dalunggan or dunggan or
dawunggan 'ear'.

This alternation is for the most part confined to the root.[1] Otherwise, it is so regular that only
the forms containing /l/ are listed, and the presumption is made that the /l/ may be dropped unless
a note is made to the contrary.[2]

5.212   Post-consonantal /l/

There is a tendency to drop post-consonantal /l/ usually (but not always) with compensatory
lengthening of the vowel of the penult: kinahanglan or kinahángan 'need'; aplud or apud 'astringent
in taste'; danglug or dángug or dangug 'slippery'. The /l/-less forms are most common in the
areas which drop intervocalic /l/. The dropping of post-consonantal /l/ is by no means as wide-*spread
as dropping of intervocalic /l/, and alternative forms are listed.

5.213   Final /l/

In Bohol and southern Leyte there is a tendency for /al/ at the end of a word to become /aw/
and /ul/ to become /u/: bagal or bagaw 'shell'. In this case alternative forms are listed.

5.214  Change of /l/ to /y/

Historically, intervocalic /l/ in isolated dialects became /y/. Forms with /y/ for /l/ have spread
throughout the Cebuano-speaking area, and some are in competition with /l/-retaining forms:
tingáli or tingáyi 'perhaps'; kalugpus or kayugpus (also kugpus--by the rule of 5.211) 'fold the
arms'. In this case, competing forms are listed with cross reference.

5.22   Assimilation and metathesis

There is a tendency for nasal consonants which abut on consonants to be assimilated: bungdul
or bundul 'poke'; hingbis or himbis 'scales'; amgid or anggid (also ambid) 'like'. This alternation
is sporadic, and competing forms are listed.

There is some competition between forms with voiced and forms with voiceless consonants,
where the competition derives from assimilation: tikbas or tigbas 'strike with a blade'; bukdu or
bugdu 'bulging out'. Again the competing forms are listed.

There is also competition between forms which differ by virtue of metathesis: bungdul or
dungbul (and dumbul) 'poke'; itsa or ista 'throw'; bàgu /ba[?]gu/ or bag-u /bag[?]u/ 'new'. (Cf.
Section 5.14.) Competing forms that differ by virtue of metathesis are listed except for forms
containing a sequence /C[?]/ which invariably compete with forms containing /[?]C/.

5.23   Change of vowels

The vowel of the antepenult sporadically may change to /a/: kumusta or kamusta 'how are, is';
batíis or bitíis 'leg'. Occasionally /a/ or /u/ is assimilated to a following /y/ or an /i/ in the following
syllable: biyà or bayà 'leave'; musimus or misimus 'lowly'. In these cases competing forms are
listed.

1 The existence of forms similar in meaning with initial l and initial vowel, e.g. lárag--árag 'for leaves to fall
off', shows that this sound change also crossed morphological boundaries when it was in effect.

2 Thus, for example: salámat 'thanks' is everywhere with /l/ and a notation to this effect is made in the
listing of salámat. But for balay 'house', for example, we make no entry for báy because from the listing of
balay with no further comment alone the reader may deduce a form báy.
-----File: 0016.png---\jhellingman\maning\triggerhippie77\-----------------

5.24  Change of /y/ to /dy/

In Bohol and Southern Leyte /y/ becomes /j/ (written dy). Some forms with dy have spread
throughout the Cebuano speech area or occur only in the Bohol-Southern Leyte speech. Such
forms are listed with dy.[1] Other forms with dy are listed as with y, and the reader may conclude
that these forms have /dy/ in Bohol and Southern Leyte.

5.25   Competing forms where no sound change is involved

Roots which are not relatable by the above rules are given separate definitions. The exception
to this rule is equivalent names of flora and fauna and technical terms which refer to exactly the
same cultural forms: e.g. gwayabanu, labanu, malabanu, síku karabaw are all the same plant
(Anona muricata); humagbus and hinablus both refer to the same relationship.

6.1  Inflection

Verb forms are subject to the addition of a small list of affixes which we call INFLECTIONAL
AFFIXES. The inflectional affixes specify three tenses: PAST, FUTURE, and SUBJUNCTIVE; four
cases or voices: ACTIVE, DIRECT PASSIVE, LOCAL PASSIVE, and INSTRUMENTAL PASSIVE; and
two modes: POTENTIAL and NONPOTENTIAL. The nonpotential forms are further broken down
into two aspects: PUNCTUAL and DURATIVE. The punctual-durative distinction exists in all
voices but is observed only in the active voice.[2] In the passive voices punctual forms are used for
all meanings, except for literary or dialectal styles where the durative-nondurative distinction is
maintained. The following chart shows these affixes. Their meaning[**meanings] are listed and exemplified in
entries in the dictionary listed under mu-, mag-_{1}, maka-_{1}, -un_{1}, ma-_{1}, -an_{1}, i-_{1}.[3] In the following

1 There are also forms with dy (/j/) which do not come from an older /y/, e.g. pangadyi 'pray'.

2 The occurrence of the tense affixation is predictable: a verb form which occurs with a given voice-mode
affix in one tense occurs also in the same voice and mode in the other tenses. The voice, mode, and aspect
affixes, however, are not predictable. Some verbs occur in one, some in two, some in three, some in all four
voices; some occur only in the potential mode, some with only durative active affixes, and so forth.

3 These affixes are the future forms shown in the chart of this section. The entries define the voice and mode
differences exhaustively. The difference in tense meanings (between future, past, and subjunctive) are described
in this note. The forms designated FUTURE refer to future time (as the name suggests):

Palitun ku ang isdà, I will buy the fish.
Akuy mupalit ug isdà, I will buy some fish.
Kinahanglang palitun nímu, You must buy it.

They also may refer to habitual actions and general statements.

Maáyu siyang mulútug kík, He bakes cakes well.
Mupalit kug isdà káda adlaw, I buy fish every day.
Mupula ug lutúun, If you cook it, it will turn red or When you cook it, it turns red.

They may also refer to exhortations:

Palitun ta! Let's buy it!
Mupalit tag isdà, Let's buy some fish.

The forms designated PAST refer to past actions.

Gipalit ku ang isdà, I bought the fish.
Nakatilaw na kug isdà, I have already tasted fish.
Sa nagpalit kug isdà, As I was buying fish.

They also refer to actions still going on.

Naghilak ang bátà, The child is crying.
Naglútù pa siya sa isdà, He is still cooking the fish.

The forms designated as SUBJUNCTIVE occur in a phrase and following a form which itself indicates time: e.g.
kagahápun 'yesterday', walà 'not (past)', anus-a 'when (future)', sa miáging Duminggu 'last Sunday', adtu 'there
(future)', túa 'there (present)', and the like.

Ugmà níya palita, He will buy it tomorrow.
Anus-a nímu palita ang isdà? When will you buy the fish?
Didtu níya palita, He bought it there.
Sunud Duminggu níya palita, He will buy it next Sunday.
Walà níya palita, He did not buy it.

The passive subjunctive forms are also used as imperative forms:

Palita ang isdà! Buy the fish!
Ayaw lutúa, Don't cook it.
Limpiyúhi ninyu! You (plural) clean it.

Further examples of the tense differences can be found in the definitions of the future case-mode affixes listed
as entries in the dictionary. The listing under untà, 2a illustrates the use of the future and past in the apodosis
of conditions contrary to fact.
-----File: 0017.png---\jhellingman\TIMP\triggerhippie77\-------------------
chart commas indicate forms which are in free variation (nearly synonymous and mutually substitutable).
A preceding hyphen indicates a suffix, following hyphen a prefix, and hyphen in the
middle, a circumfix. Dialectal affixes are not listed. The asterisks mark forms which are not normally
used in colloquial speech.

6.2 Verbal derivation

The inflectional affixes are added not only to roots (forms containing no other affixes) but also
to derived bases (forms containing further affixes). The productive affixes which are added to
roots to form bases which in turn may have inflectional affixes added to them are -ay, -an, pa-,
paN-,[1] ka-, hi-, ha-, hiN-, pakig-, paki-, panggi-, pani-, paniN-[1]. These affixes are given entries in the
dictionary and exemplified there.

When the active inflectional affixes are added to verb bases which contain some of these derivative
prefixes, they undergo morphophonemic alternations as shown in the following chart:

together with prefix        ni- (mi-, ning-) becomes           mu- becomes

7.0 Classification of roots according to their system of affixation

With the rich system of derivational and inflectional affixations to which Cebuano roots are
subject, there are literally hundreds of different affixed forms for any given root. Since it is manifestly
impossible to list exhaustively all affixations for any given root, we follow the principle
here that PRODUCTIVE FORMATIONS are generally not listed unless there is s.t. especial

1 The phonemic value of the morphophonemic symbol N is given in the following chart:

For roots beginning with                    N plus the initial consonant after root produces
p, b                                        m
t, d, s                                     n
k, [?] (written as initial vowel), ng       ng
l                                           ngl or, alternatively, nl
other consonants or clusters of consonants  ng plus initial consonant

Examples: palit + paN- = pamalit 'buy'; baligyà + paN- = pamaligyà 'sell'; tindug + paN- = panindug 'stand';
dala + paN- = panala 'bring'; sulud + paN- = panulud 'enter'; kúhà + paN- = pangúhà 'take'; ábang + paN- =
pangábang 'rent'; ngisi + paN- = pangisi 'be intent on'; lútù + paN- = panglútù, panlútù 'cook'; hisus + paN- =
panghisus 'exclaim Jesus!'.
-----File: 0018.png---\jhellingman\TIMP\triggerhippie77\-------------------
about their meanings or morphophonemics. By PRODUCTIVE FORMATIONS we mean affixes
which are added to all, or almost all, members of a certain group of roots. For example, the affix
ka-an_{2} is added to any root which refers to a plant to form a collective noun referring to a place
where a group of that type of plant is found. The formation, ka-[plant]-an, is not listed except in
cases where there is s.t. special about the affixation, as for example kalubinhan 'coconut grove'
(from lubi) which undergoes special morphophonemics or kabaknitan 'thicket' (from baknit 'k.o.
vine'), where the meaning of the affixed form is not predictable from the meaning of the base and
the affixes. The following productive affixes are listed only occasionally. For their meanings and
a description of the type of roots to which they are added, see the entries: pa-1,2; paN-1a,c,
panggi-, hi-/ha-; hiN-_{1}; -ay/-anay; paka-_{2}, doubling or Culu-; -in-_{1}, -in_{2}, ka-an_{2}, -in-an_{1}, -in-an_{2},
ma-_{2}.

The inflectional affixes which may be added to a given verb base in a given meaning are indicated
by means of a formula which is explained in the following subsections. The derivational
affixes paN-1a,c, pakig-, and ka- are also indicated with these formulas.

Our classification of verbs consists of two parts separated by a semicolon: the active and
the passive. The active classes are indicated by capital letters A, B, C and numbers indicating subclasses;
and the passive classes are indicated by minuscules a, b, and c followed by numbers indicating
subclasses. E.g. palit 'buy', which is in class A; a, takes the active affixes listed for A (Section
7.11) and the passive affixes listed for a (Section 7.21). In the following subsections the
verbs mentioned as examples of each conjugation class are listed with examples for all the relevant
affixations.

7.1 Active verb classes

7.11 Class A conjugation, the action verbs

Verbs of class A refer to an action. If they are the predicate of the sentence, the subject is the
agent of the action. If they are in attribute construction, the head is the agent of the action. They
occur with mu-, meanings 1 and 2[1] (and thus also with mi-, ni-, etc.), mag-, meanings 1 and 2 (and
thus also with nag-, naga-, maga-, etc.), maka- in all meanings (and thus also with naka-, ka-, etc.).
(See the entries under these affixes for further illustration and explanation.) The entry for palit
'buy' illustrates this class; the entry for bisiklíta 'bicycle' indicates this class with verbs derived
from noun roots, and the entry for hapit,2 'drop in s.w.' illustrates this class referring to verbs of
motion.

7.111 Subclasses of the class A conjugation

The numbers which follow the letter A indicate nonoccurrence of affixes. The symbol A1
indicates verbs of the A conjugation which do not occur with the punctual-active set, mu- (mi-,
etc.). An example of a verb of this type is ikspidisiyun 'go on an expedition'. The symbol A2
indicates that the base does not occur with the durative-active set, mag- (nag-, etc.). A verb of
this class is sángit 'catch, snag s.t.'. The symbol A3 indicates that the base does not occur with the
potential-active set, maka- (naka-, etc.), e.g. habhab,3 'eat away a portion of s.t.'. Two numbers
following the letter A indicate the absence of two of the three active affixes. E.g. A12
indicates a base which occurs only with maka- (naka-, etc.) but not with mu- and mag-, e.g. salà.

The symbol A13 indicates lack of mu- and maka- but occurrence of mag-, e.g. dahum 'expect'.

The symbol S following a number indicates that the base occurs with the prefix represented,
but that there is shift (Section 5.11). E.g. dalágan 'run' is in class A2S: it occurs with all three sets,
but the penult is short when the durative affixes, mag-, etc., are added. Dáwat 'receive' is in class
A3S: it occurs with all three active sets, but the penult is short when the potential affixes, maka-,
etc., are added.

The symbol P following the letter A indicates that the unaffixed root and the root plus pa-
have exactly the same meaning and are used interchangeably with the active affixes: e.g. mala
'dry'.

The symbol A3P indicates that the root occurs with both maka- (naka-) and, alternatively, with
makapa- (nakapa-) with no difference in meaning. Further, the base occurs with nonpotential

1 See the entry for mu-.
-----File: 0019.png---\lotus951\jhellingman\triggerhippie77\---------------
affixes, but with the nonpotential active affixes, pa- cannot be added to the base without changing
the meaning. The symbol A123P means that the root occurs only with potential-active affixes
(i.e., does not occur with mu- or mag-), but it does occur with maka- and also with makapa- having
the same meaning as maka-, e.g. malarya 'get malaria'.

The symbol N following A or A plus the numbers indicates that the prefix paN- can be added
to the base together with the punctual-active affix, mu-, and with the potential-active affix maka-
(naka-) but not with the durative affixes, and that the root alone is synonymous with the base plus
paN-. That is to say, the form mu- (mi-)[root] and maN- (naN-)[root][1] are synonymous, and
maka- (naka-)[root] is synonymous with nakapaN-[root] and makapaN-[root]. An example of a
root of the AN conjugation is sanghid 'ask permission'.

7.12  Class B conjugation, the stative verbs

Verbs of class B refer to s.t. that happened to s.o. or s.t. If they are the predicate of the sentence,
the subject is the thing to which the event happened. Verbs of class B occur with mu- (mi-,
etc.), meaning 3, mag- (nag-, etc.), meaning 3, ma- (na-, etc.), meaning 3, maka- (naka-, etc.) or,
alternatively, makapa- (nakapa-) with a meaning 'cause s.t. to become [so-and-so]', and with
magka-_{2} (nagka-, etc.). The entry for pula 'red' illustrates this conjugation. The entry for duktur
'doctor' illustrates a verb of this class formed from a noun root.

7.121 Subclasses of verbs of the B conjugation

Verbs of class B1 lack mu-, e.g. págud 'get burnt'. Verbs of class B2 lack mag-, e.g. palanas 'be
eroded'. Verbs of B3 occur with maka- but have a meaning 'become [so-and-so]', e.g. laun 'age'.
Verbs of class B3(1) occur with maka- in two meanings: (1) become [so-and-so], and (2) cause to
become [so-and-so]. In the latter meaning it also occurs with makapa- (nakapa-), e.g. lup-ut_{2}
'thicken'. Verbs of class B4 lack na- (ma-). E.g. laúsag 'got worse and worse'. Verbs of class B5 lack
maka- (naka-) and verbs of class B6 lack magka-_{2}, e.g. paliyar 'for an engine to malfunction'. Many
verbs in the class B conjugation have one or more of these conjugational features. E.g. duktur as a
verb 'become a doctor' is in class B16,--i.e. it lacks mu- and lacks magka-.

The symbol[**symbols] S and N are used just as with the verbs of the A conjugation. The symbolization
B2S indicates that the penult is short with the durative affixes (mag-, etc.), e.g. lúya 'get weak'. A
symbol BN indicates that paN- may be added to the base with the volitional affix (mu-) and that
the root plus mu- (mi-, etc.) does not differ in meaning from the root plus maN- (naN-).[1] An
example of a verb of conjugation BN is pula.

7.13   Class C conjugation, the mutual action verbs

Verbs of class C refer to an action which two or more agents engage in mutually. Verbs in this
class usually have a long penult and shift the stress to the penult if the final syllable of the unaffixed
root is stressed. Verbs of this class occur with the durative prefixes, mag-_{1}, (nag-, etc.),
meaning 5, with the potential prefix magka-_{1} (nagka-), and with the prefix makig- (nakig-). The
entry for sábut 'come to an understanding' (under sabut (<-)) illustrates a verb of class C conjugation.

7.131  Subclasses of the class C conjugation

The symbol C1 refers to verbs which lack the durative set, mag-. The symbol C2 refers to verbs
which lack the potential set, magka-. The symbol C3 refers to verbs which lack the set makig-. The
listing for balíus 'miss each other' exemplifies a verb of class C13 (missing both mag-_{1} and makig-).
The entry púyù 'live together' illustrates a verb of class C2 (lacking the potential form magka-_{1}).

7.2 Passive verb classes

7.21  Class a verbs

Verbs of class a occur with direct passive affixes (see the entry for -un_{1}), and the direct passive

1 maN- is analyzed morphophonemically as mu- plus paN-, and naN- as mi- plus paN-. See Section 6.2.
-----File: 0020.png---\jhellingman\TIMP\triggerhippie77\-------------------
verb refers to a FOCUS[1] which is the recipient of the action (see -un_{1}, meaning 1). Verbs of class
a normally also occur with the local passive affixes (see -an_{1}) referring to a focus which is the place
or beneficiary of the action (-an_{1}, meaning 1). They also occur with the instrumental passive affixes
(see i-_{1}) in the instrumental, beneficial, and temporal meanings (i-_{1}, meanings 2, 3, and 4).
Palit 'buy' illustrates a verb of class a. Hapit 'drop in' and dalágan 'run' illustrate verbs of class a
that refer to motion. Ábut (under ábut) 'meet with each other' illustrates a verb of class a conjugation
referring to mutual action. Dakù illustrates an adjective with class a conjugation. Bisiklíta
and duktur illustrate two different kinds of nouns with class a conjugation.

7.211 Subclasses of the class a conjugation

Verbs in class a1 lack a local passive; verbs in class a2 lack an instrumental passive (except in
the benefactive and temporal meanings [-i_{1}, meanings 3 and 4], to which all verbs in the language
are subject). Verbs in class a12 lack both the local and the instrumental passive. The verb daug,1[**closed up space before 1]
'overcome' exemplifies this conjugation. Verbs in class a3 have only potential passive affixes, e.g.
dungug,1 'hear'. Verbs in class a4 refer to a focus which is the thing suffering from or affected by
the thing referred to by the verb (-un_{1}, meaning 2), e.g. malarya 'get malaria'.

7.22 Class b verbs

Verbs of class b occur with a local passive affix, and the local passive refers to a focus which is
the recipient of the action (see -an_{1}, meaning 2). Verbs of this class also normally occur with the
instrumental passive affixes (see i-_{1}) in the instrumental, beneficial, and temporal meanings (i-_{1},
meanings 2, 3, and 4). Haluk 'kiss' illustrates a verb of class b conjugation.

7.221  Subclasses of class b

The symbol b(1) indicates verbs of class b which lack the instrumental passive conjugation (in
any but the benefactive and temporal meanings [i-_{1}, meanings 3 and 4], to which all verbs in
Cebuano are subject). An example of a b(1) verb is bantay 'watch'.

The symbol b1 indicates verbs the local passives of which refer to a focus which is the place of
the action (-an_{1}, meaning 1) or, in another meaning, to the recipient of the action (-an_{1}, in meaning
2). Laba 'wash' illustrates a verb of this type.

The symbol b2 indicates verbs of the a conjugation, the local passive of which refers to the
place of the action, but which also occur with the affix hi-an(->) (hi-i), meaning 2, to refer to the
accidental recipient of the action. Bása 'read' illustrates a verb in class ab2.

The symbol b3 indicates verbs the local passive of which refers to the reason for the action.[**extra . ?]
(-an_{1}, meaning 5). Dalágan 'run' illustrates this class. The symbol b3(1) indicates verbs of class b3
which occur only with potential affixes (ma-/na-an/-i or, alternatively, gika-/ka-an/-i). Hadluk 'be
afraid' illustrates a verb of b3(1).

The symbol b4 indicates verbs the local passive of which refers to a focus which is the thing
affected by the action or the thing this verb refers to (-an_{1}, meaning 4). Buntag,3 'be overtaken by
morning' illustrates a verb of this class. The symbol b4(1) indicates verbs of class b4 which have
only potential affixes. Walà 'lose' illustrates a verb of this class.

The symbol b5 refers to verbs the local passive and the direct passive of which are synonymous,
i.e. occur with -un_{1}, in meaning 1, and -an_{1}, in meaning 2, where there is no difference between the
two sets of affixation.[2] Abli,2 'open' illustrates a verb of this class.

The symbol b6 refers to verbs which have no passive other than the local passive and the instrumental
passive in the benefactive or temporal meanings (-i_{1}, meanings 3 and 4), and, further, the

1 The term FOCUS is given to the word to which the verb refers. If the verb is the head of the predicate of
the sentence, the FOCUS is the subject (in bold face in the following examples):

Gipalit níya ang pán, He bought the bread.

If the verb is the subject of the sentence, the FOCUS is the predicate:

Pán ang íyang gipalit, It was bread that he bought.

If the verb modifies a noun (is attribute to a noun), the noun is the FOCUS:

Ang pán nga íyang gipalit, The bread he bought.

2 In cases of bases which occur with direct passive affixes in the direct meaning (-un_{1},1)[**closed up space after ,] and with local passives
in the direct meaning (-an_{1}, in meaning 1), but the two are not synonymous, the verb is classed ab.
-----File: 0021.png---\jhellingman\TIMP\triggerhippie77\-------------------
local passive refers to a focus which is the place or the beneficiary of the action (-an_{1}, meaning 1),
or, in the case of adjectives, refers to a focus which is the person who considered s.o.[**pencil: s.t.] to be [adjective].
Kulumbítay 'hang' is an example of a verb of class b6. The symbol b6(1) refers to verbs of
this sort which also occur with an instrumental passive in the instrumental meaning--i.e. the
focus of the instrumental passive is the instrument with which the action of the verb is carried out
(i-_{1}, meaning 2). Dagkut,1 'light' is an example of a verb of class b6(1).

The symbol b7 indicates verbs the local passive of which refers to a focus which is s.t. diminished
or added to (-an_{1}, meaning 2a). Kúhà 'take' illustrates a verb of this conjugation.

The symbol b8 indicates verbs which have only potential local passives. Kamau 'know' (listed
under mau) is a verb of class b8.

7.23 Class c verbs

Verbs of class c have instrumental passive affixes which refer to a focus which is the thing
conveyed by the action or the direct recipient of the action (see i-_{1}, meaning 1). Verbs of class c
normally also occur with the local passive affixes (-an_{1}) referring to a focus which is the place or
the beneficiary of the action (-an_{1}, meaning 1). Lábay 'throw away' illustrates a verb of this type.
Dalágan,1 illustrates a verb of class c which refers to motion.

7.231 Subclasses of class c verbs

The symbol c1 indicates verbs for which the direct and the instrumental passive are synonymous
(i.e. occur with -un_{1} in meaning 1 and wich[**with |P3: c actually t partially obscured] i-_{1} in meaning 1; and the meaning of the form composed
of i- plus the base is synonymous with -un plus the base).[1] Most verbs derived from adjectives
are in class c1.

The symbol c2 indicates verbs for which the local and the instrumental passive forms are
synonymous, where with the local passive and the instrumental passive forms refer to a focus which
is the recipient of the action (-an_{1}, meaning 2, and i-_{1}, meaning 1). An example of a verb in class
c2 is dusù 'shove'.

The symbol c3 indicates verbs the instrumental passive of which refers to a focus which is the
recipient of the action (i-, meaning 2), but which occur only with the potential affixes ika-, gika-.
A verb in class c3 is isturya 'talk to'.

The symbol c4 refers to verbs which optionally take a prefix ig-_{1} for the future instrumental
passive nonpotential form and igka-_{1} for the future instrumental passive potential form. Dúngug,3
(listed under dungug (<-)) 'hear from' is an example of a verb in class c4.

The symbol c5 refers to verbs the instrumental passive of which refers to a focus which is the
reason on account of which the agent came into [such-and-such] a state (-i, meaning 5, and ika-_{1}[** ,]
meaning 2). Lípay 'be happy' is an example of a verb with c5 conjugation.

The symbol c6 refers to verbs of class c which do not occur with local passive affixes.

1 If a base occurs with the direct and the instrumental passive, where i- has the meaning 1, but the direct
and instrumental passive forms are not synonymous, the verb is said to be in class ac, e.g. lábay 'throw'. Dalágan
'run' is an example of a verb referring to motion in the ac conjugation.
