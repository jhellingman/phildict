This Spanish-Cebuano dictionary was first published in 1851 in Manila. The second edition, on which this ebook is based, dates from 1866 and was printed in Binondo (now also part of Manila). Its author, Juan Félis de la Encarnacion, was an discalced Augustinian friar and twice a provincial at the church of San Nicolas de Tolentino in Manila.
As a dictionary it has several shortcomings. First, its spelling of Cebuano is highly inconsistent, and second, it appears to be based on a Spanish glossary with all the meanings translated to Cebuano. Some liberties have been taken in those translations, and, when a proper Cebuano word was not available, a short explanation was added. Do not trust them to much. It is curious for example that the entry Vergarzoso, ‘armadillo’, just glosses ‘animal from America’! Similarly, many Spanish names of specific species of birds, the gloss is simply langgam, ‘bird’, regardless whether the Spanish word designates a vulture, bee-eater, hoopoo, etc. The entry for Unicornio translates as ‘an animal like a horse, with just one horn’, without any hint of its mythological character. Nevertheless, this dictionary is a valuable resource because documents Cebuano as it was some 150 years ago.
