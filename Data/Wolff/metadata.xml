      <dc:description>A Dictionary of Cebuano Visayan, edited by John U Wolf and first published in 1972, is still one of the best dictionaries made for Cebuano. It was based on original research between 1966 and 1972, in which the editor and his team collected samples of actual written and spoken Cebuano to use in this dictionary. Besides providing English definitions, it provides sample sentences for many words, all taken from daily usage.</dc:description>
